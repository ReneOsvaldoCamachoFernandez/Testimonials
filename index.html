          <h2 id="short-review">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2>
          <p id="long-review">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          <p id="long-review">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
            programgave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable

      <h2 id="short-review">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
      <p id="long-review">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
        theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
        often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
        job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
